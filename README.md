## Thesis Abstract:
This thesis explores the usability of Large Language Models for the purpose of expertise location,
using a leading consulting firm in the Nordics as a case study. A tailored Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) architecture emerges as the most suitable model, outperforming a custom SQL
Agent for expertise location. Consequently, an instance of RAG was designed, deployed and tested
as ‘WaldoGPT’, following a holistic approach. Generally, this work contributes as a proof that RAG
is usable in settings where objective ground truths are missing, unlike its initial use case of factual
question-answering. On a technical level, the main enabler of RAG for candidate recommendations is
an innovative per-candidate chunk scoring system, which is transferable to other use cases. WaldoGPT
contributes a modularised perspective on RAG, where each module is tuned for the use case and
underlying dataset, including a non-discriminatory metadata filtering mechanism. Testing revealed
that WaldoGPT yields satisfying responses (mean agreement level 4.01/5.00) and has the potential to
improve daily lives and workflows (4.75/5.00). Recognising that organisational challenges often hinder
the adoption of new knowledge management solutions, WaldoGPT is accompanied by a comprehensive
adoption roadmap.
